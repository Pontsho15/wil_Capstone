can only 1 person chair the meeting because others tell us how they wont hire us at the end of the 3 months and we already know that telling us is just rude 
can we try to join the meetings at exactly 14:00 so that we can have more time to be evaluated and get suggestions for improvement 
Since we are working on 1 project ,i think one of us  can present the screen then the rest will explain their part if they are stuck with something.
